Use the Shaft Component Generator to design the shape of a shaft.

Use the Shaft Component Generator to:

* Design and insert shafts with unlimited number of sections (cylinders, cones, polygons) and features (fillets, chamfers, threads, and more).
* Design shaft of a hollow shape.
* Insert features (chamfers, fillets, threads) onto the inner bores.
* Split shaft cylinder and retain the length of the shaft section.
